#### Aim: 

* To simulate and observe various types of signals and their graphs.
* To simulate and observe various types of systems and operations on systems.

### Task 2:

#### Aim:

* To check the properties of “DISCRETE-TIME FOURIER TRANSFORM”To perform the frequency analysis of Z transform of a signal.
* Linear Property of DTFT.
* Time Shifting Property of DTFT.
* To understand linear convolution in MATLAB.

### Task 3:

#### Aim:

* To find the 8 and 16 point DFT.
* Circular Convolution.

### Task 4:

#### Aim:

* Create a Butterworth Filter.
* Create Chebyshev Filters (Order 1 and Order 2).
* Create a Butterworth Highpass Filter.
* Create a Chebyshev Highpass Filter.
* Create a Filter Using FVTOOL.

### Task 5: (Hardware)

#### Aim:
